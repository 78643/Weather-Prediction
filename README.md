# 🌦️ Weather Prediction using Machine Learning 🧠

Welcome to my **Weather Prediction** project!  
This machine learning-based system is designed to predict **weather conditions** (e.g., whether it will rain or not) using real-world weather data. The project focuses on two classification algorithms: **Logistic Regression (LR)** and **Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)**.

---

## 🚀 Objective

To classify weather conditions based on features like temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, etc.  
We aim to provide accurate weather forecasting using ML techniques.

---

## 🧪 Models Applied

| 🔢 Model                  | 🎯 Accuracy |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| 📈 Logistic Regression (LR) | **90%**     |
| 🌲 Decision Tree Classifier (DTC) | 88%      |

✅ **Logistic Regression** performed slightly better with higher generalization.

## 🧠 Workflow Overview

1. 📥 Load dataset
2. 🧹 Handle missing/null values and preprocess features
3. 📊 Perform EDA (data insights, trends)
4. ⚙️ Train LR and DTC models
5. ✅ Evaluate and compare both models
6. 🏆 Select the best-performing model for predictions

---

## 🧾 Results & Conclusion

- 📈 **Logistic Regression gave 90% accuracy** — better for linear relationships
- 🌲 **Decision Tree gave 88% accuracy** — captures non-linear patterns
- 🔍 LR selected due to higher accuracy and performance consistency

---

## 💡 Future Scope

- 🌳 Add more models like Random Forest, SVM, or XGBoost
- 🔍 Apply hyperparameter tuning
- 🌐 Deploy model using Flask or Streamlit for user interaction
- 📦 Create a web-based weather app with real-time inputs
